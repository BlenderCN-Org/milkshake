# SamTools for Blender

This Python package is a random collection of tools I've written over the years, as and when they came in handy. There's no guarantee that they'll always (if ever) be useful to anyone else.
I'm also tinkering with them every once in a while, so no guarantees towards bugs and the squashing of them, either.

## Installation

1. Download this repository as a zip file.
1. Without unpacking, install it via the `Install Add-on From File` button in User Preferences > Add-ons.
1. The SamTools category will be available in the Tools area of the 3D View.
